# Practical Machine Learning Project
Background:
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike Fuel Band, and Fit bit, it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, our goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. I could use any of the other variables to predict with. 

Questions:
How do you built your model? 
How do you use cross validation?
What do you think the expected out of sample error is? 
Why did you make the choices you did?
